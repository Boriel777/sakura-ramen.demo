# 🚀 Sakura Ramen – Onepager for a Fictional Ramen Restaurant

<em>A static, semantically structured website with minimal CSS and carefully handcoded HTML.</em>

---

## 💡 The Idea
This project was created as a **stylistic exercise and portfolio piece**.  
The goal was to build a simple, charming restaurant website focusing on structure, clarity, and personal craftsmanship.

- Implementation based on an external design  
- Fully handcoded in **HTML5 & CSS3**  
- No CMS, no templates—everything written by hand  
- Focus on semantics, typography, and visual storytelling  
- **Not yet responsive**—intentionally kept static as a base version  

---

## 🎨 My Approach
I wanted to demonstrate that good structure, design sense, and handcrafted work can shine **without JavaScript or frameworks**:

- **Step 1: Analyze the Design** – Break down layout, typography, and visual hierarchy  
- **Step 2: Handcode HTML & CSS** – Emphasize semantics, readability, and minimal styling  
- **Step 3: Polish Visuals** – Add typographic emphasis and Japanese aesthetic touches  
- **Step 4: Test & Refine** – Keep layout clean, simple, and visually consistent  

---

## ⚡ Key Highlights
- Static one-page layout, lightweight and readable  
- Typography-focused design with Japanese aesthetic inspiration  
- Navigation and layout optimized for simplicity and clarity  
- Icons and graphics embedded via CSS—no external libraries
