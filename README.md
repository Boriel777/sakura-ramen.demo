# 🚀 Sakura Ramen – Onepager for a Fictional Ramen Restaurant

<em>A fully handcoded, fully responsive website with minimal CSS and carefully crafted HTML, built as part of Developer Academy exercises.</em>

---

## 💡 The Idea
This project was created as a **stylistic exercise and portfolio piece during my Developer Academy education**.  
The goal was to build a simple, charming restaurant website focusing on structure, clarity, and personal craftsmanship.

- Implementation based on an external design  
- Fully handcoded in **HTML5 & CSS3**  
- No CMS, no templates—everything written by hand  
- Focus on semantics, typography, and visual storytelling  
- **Fully responsive** – optimized for all screen sizes  

---

## 🎨 My Approach
I wanted to demonstrate that good structure, design sense, and handcrafted work can shine **without JavaScript frameworks**:

- **Step 1: Analyze the Design** – Break down layout, typography, and visual hierarchy  
- **Step 2: Handcode HTML & CSS** – Emphasize semantics, readability, and minimal styling  
- **Step 3: Implement Responsiveness** – Mobile-first design using Flexbox and media queries  
- **Step 4: Polish & Test** – Ensure layout works on all devices and remains visually consistent

## ⚡ Key Highlights
- Static one-page layout, lightweight and readable  
- Typography-focused design with Japanese aesthetic inspiration  
- Navigation and layout optimized for simplicity and clarity  
- Icons and graphics embedded via CSS—no external libraries  
- Fully responsive design
